# BITB-006: Add Staging Environment

**As a** product owner,
**I want** a staging environment that mirrors production,
**so that** we can validate changes before they affect real users.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Terraform workspace or separate config for staging
- [ ] Staging environment deployed to Azure with same services as prod
- [ ] Staging uses separate database with test data
- [ ] CI/CD deploys to staging on merge to `main`, production on tag/release
- [ ] Staging URL accessible to team (e.g., `staging.getinspiredbythebible.ai4you.sh`)
- [ ] Documentation includes staging deployment process

**Tech Constraints:**

- Must minimize cost (use lower-tier resources than prod)
- Must share same codebase as production
- Must support Terraform state isolation

**Out of Scope:**

- Automated promotion from staging to production
- Staging database anonymization (can use fresh Bible data)
